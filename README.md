# Unemployment-Rate

As an analyst, I'm excited to share my recent project exploring the unemployment rates in South Africa and Qatar between 2018 and 2021. 
Through a combination of Python and Tableau,
I was able to gather and analyze data on the maximum and minimum unemployment rates in both countries.
After diving into the data, I found that South Africa had the highest unemployment rate among countries,
with a maximum rate of 29.22% in 2020. Meanwhile, 
Qatar had the lowest unemployment rate, with a minimum rate of 0.14% in 2018.
Using Python, I was able to clean and transform the data into a format that was easy to visualize and analyze.
With Tableau, I created interactive visualizations that showcased the differences among the countries over the years.
This project was not only a great opportunity for me to improve my technical skills but also allowed me to gain valuable insights into the economic landscape of these countries.
By sharing my findings, I hope to contribute to the ongoing conversation around employment and help others gain a better understanding of the current situation in many countries.
